# Fructose-HMF-Model
This MatLab Code solves the PFR model for the acid-catalyzed dehydration of
fructose to HMF using HCl as the catalyst and generates the kinetic data for 
conversion, yield, and selectivity of the species as a function of temperature, 
pH, and time. All the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were taken from the 
kinetic model by T. Dallas Swift et al. ACS Catal 2014, 4,259-267.
